Cicada works with whatever is playing on your Mac, from Zoom, Teams, and Feishu calls to X Spaces, Discord stages, and YouTube livestreams. By listening directly to system audio, it gives you live bilingual subtitles and structured meeting notes without sending bots into the call or asking anyone else to install a thing. And when you need to jump in, just hold the right `⌥` key to speak and broadcast your translated voice straight into the meeting.

## Features

### Live notes and bilingual transcript

While the meeting runs, the notes window organizes a summary, topics and key points, conclusions, to-dos, a fishbone diagram, and a glossary of names and terms, and every conclusion or to-do clicks straight back to the supporting lines in the bilingual transcript. Cicada unifies names and terms across the notes and remembers misrecognized spellings, so `⌘F` searches both the canonical spelling and the variants.

### Live subtitles and language detection

Cicada detects the spoken language on device within seconds and translates into your system language, and pressing `⌃⌥S` switches between the notes window, a compact subtitle bar, and hidden. The subtitle bar appears only when someone speaks and turns see-through under your pointer so you can click right through it.

### Speak back in their language

Hold the right `⌥` key and speak so the room hears your translated voice through BlackHole 2ch, a virtual microphone you can install from the app with one click and that Cicada switches to automatically while interpreting is on. With a Ling API key, the other side hears natural Ming voices or a clone of your own voice from an 8 to 30 second sample, and without a key it uses macOS system voices.

### Meeting records

Every session saves its bilingual transcript, notes, and audio recording on your Mac, and turning on experimental speaker identification separates voices on the other side and fills in their names when a Ling key is set. Cicada ends the session and trims the silent tail when the call hangs up or after 10 minutes of silence, and you can generate notes later or export to Markdown, Word, or SRT subtitles. Right now "you" in the transcript covers only what you say while holding the talk key; recording what you say directly into the meeting is on the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Privacy & Permissions

Audio capture, language detection, speech recognition (Apple SpeechAnalyzer), and meeting recordings all stay on your Mac. The only data that leaves your device is the recognized text sent for translation and meeting notes, plus the short audio clips you speak while holding the talk key when using a Ling API key. Without an API key, subtitles, translation (via Google with Apple on-device fallback), meeting records, and push-to-talk interpreting all work. Live meeting notes, one-step voice translation, and voice cloning use your own Ling API key (Ant Group's model service, see [below](#ling-api-key)), and an hour of live notes costs roughly ¥0.15 to ¥1 at current Ling pricing. Ling gives ¥10 of credit every month, enough for about 10 to 50 hours of meetings.

Cicada asks for a permission only when you use the feature that needs it, and everything else keeps working if you decline.

| Permission | What it's for | When it's asked | Without it |
|---|---|---|---|
| System audio recording (Screen & System Audio Recording) | Hearing what your Mac plays, for subtitles. Never records the screen or its own sound | Onboarding step 1, or the first time it listens | No subtitles or notes |
| Microphone | Recording only while you hold the talk key, for speak-back | When you turn on speak-back | No speak-back |
| Input Monitoring | Only to tell whether the right `⌥` was pressed on its own (listen-only; nothing is blocked or logged) | The first time you talk with right `⌥` | Pick a `⌃`/`⌘` combination in Settings instead; it needs no permission |
| Administrator password | Installing the BlackHole 2ch virtual microphone and restarting the system audio service | When you click Install in onboarding or Settings, once | The room can't hear your translation; everything else works |

- **Network and virtual microphone**. Cicada only connects to Google Translate (`translate.googleapis.com`), Ling / Ming when a key is configured (`api.ant-ling.com`), the official BlackHole download, and GitHub once a day for update checks. BlackHole is downloaded from the official Apple-notarized package and verified against a hardcoded SHA-256 checksum before installing.
- **No analytics or servers of our own**. There is no analytics, no tracking, and no backend server. Diagnostics only log timings and counts locally in the meeting folder.
- **Local storage**. Meetings, recordings, and notes live in `~/Library/Application Support/LiveSubs`. Your Ling key and voice sample are readable only by your user account, excluded from Time Machine backups, and never written to logs or exports.
- **Private notes window**. Hidden from screen sharing, screen recording, and screenshots, unless you turn on the option to show it during screen sharing to record a demo.

## Models

Without a Ling key, everything runs on Apple's on-device models plus Google Translate. With a key, Ling and Ming models handle the tasks below and fall back automatically if a request fails.

| Feature | With a Ling key | Without a key / fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Speech recognition and language detection | Apple `SpeechAnalyzer` / `SpeechTranscriber` (on device) | same |
| Translating finished sentences | Ling `Ling-3.1-flash` (or `Ling-3.0-flash`, set in Settings › AI Service) | Google Translate → Apple `Translation` (on device) |
| Translating the sentence still being spoken | Google Translate (saves Ling's rate limit) | Apple `Translation` (on device) |
| Live notes and the final version | Ling `Ling-3.1-flash` (same setting) | not available |
| Checking the key | Ling `Ling-3.0-tiny` (one token) | — |
| Interpreting: hearing and translating what you say | Ming `Ming-3.0-audio-flash`, one step | Apple on-device transcript, then the translation chain above |
| Interpreting: the voice the room hears, voice cloning | Ming `Ming-3.0-tts-0.5B` | macOS system voices (`AVSpeechSynthesizer`); no cloning |
| Speaker identification (说话人识别, experimental, off by default) | WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM voiceprints, bundled, on device (Core ML) | same |

## Setting up a Ling API key

1. Sign up or log in on the [Ling open platform](https://chat.ant-ling.com/platform/api).
2. Click **创建令牌** (create token) and copy the key that starts with `sk-`.
3. In Cicada, open **Settings › AI Service**, paste the key, and click **Save and check** (or paste it in the prompt at the top of the notes window). A one-token request confirms it works.
4. Optionally pick the model (`Ling-3.1-flash` by default) on the same page, and the Ming voice for each language under **Settings › Interpreting**. To remove the key, click **Remove** on the same page.

## Requirements & Installation

Requires **macOS 26 or later** on **Apple silicon**. The UI is available in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, following your macOS language or set per app in **System Settings › General › Language & Region**.

Download `Cicada-<version>-macOS-AppleSilicon.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/wquguru/cicada/releases/latest) or [the website](https://cicada.indaloop.app), open it, and drag **Cicada** into **Applications**. Builds are ad-hoc signed and not notarized yet (see [roadmap](#roadmap)), so if macOS blocks the first launch, open **System Settings › Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. Each release includes `checksums.txt`, which you can verify with `shasum -a 256 Cicada-*.dmg`. For questions, reach out to the author [@wquguru](https://x.com/wquguru) on X.

The first-launch guide asks for one permission, plays a short two-person sample meeting so you can see live subtitles right away, helps you connect your Ling key (or skip it for now), and sets up the virtual microphone if you want interpreting. Later updates show as an orange dot on the menu bar icon and install in one click without losing your permissions.

## Roadmap

In rough order; tell us what you need in Issues.

- **Recording what you say**, listening to your microphone during meetings with echo cancellation so your own proposals and to-dos are included in the transcript and notes.
- **Older macOS support (targeting macOS 14.4+)**, falling back to earlier system speech recognition and translation APIs on older versions.
- **Developer ID signing and notarization**, removing the "Open Anyway" prompt on first launch and storing the AI key in the macOS Keychain.
- **Speaker recognition**, building on today's experimental speaker identification to remember frequent meeting participants by voice on your Mac, so they're named in the next meeting too.
- **Local notes without an API key** using Apple's on-device model on supported Macs, plus **custom AI providers** for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Windows and Android**, sharing the same notes and meeting-record formats (iPhone and iPad are not planned due to iOS audio capture restrictions).

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for details and trade-offs on each item.

## Uninstall

Quit Cicada and drag it from **Applications** to the Trash. To remove all saved transcripts, notes, and audio recordings, delete `~/Library/Application Support/LiveSubs`. To clear preferences, run:

```bash
defaults delete com.wquguru.cicada
```

## Development

Building from source requires Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). Cicada has no third-party dependencies and builds directly against macOS system frameworks.

```bash
scripts/build.sh            # dev build → build/Cicada.app ("Cicada Dev", runs beside the installed app)
open build/Cicada.app
scripts/package.sh          # release DMG + zip + checksums
```

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for architecture details and release workflows. The website source lives in `site/` and is generated by `scripts/site.py`. Release history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and on the website at [cicada.indaloop.app/changelog](https://cicada.indaloop.app/changelog/).

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE). The BlackHole 2ch virtual audio driver is licensed under the GPL; Cicada does not bundle it and downloads the official release on demand when you choose to install it. The bundled voiceprint model is [WeSpeaker](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker)'s ResNet34-LM trained on VoxCeleb, licensed CC BY 4.0, converted to Core ML by `scripts/convert-voiceprint.py`.
